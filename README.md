### All of the following
***

**Important**: I am not a legal advisor. Generic templates and contracts may fail to meet your needs. Nothing on this website shall be considered legal advice and no relationship is established. Be sure to consult a lawyer to address the particulars of your specific situation.

***

Don’t have a contract of your own or want to steal some juicy bits? Go ahead and borrow ours. OBVIOUSLY, we are NOT liable for whatever mess you get yourself into. Yes, our lawyer went though ours. But her job is to represent our interests, not yours. We just share out of the goodness of our hearts.

In short: Caveat emptor

### Comments

Confidentiality may not always be necessary

Design parts are not always part of it

Important points are it sets out what I am not responsible for. That is writing content for the application, sourcing pretty pictures, uploading stuff to the database. Also that I am not a hosting company and that responsibility for uptime etc rests with heroku/amazon/dropbox and whatever services deploy the application or parts of it.

The ownership clause is there so that I can say I was the creator of that for the purposes of a portfolio.
