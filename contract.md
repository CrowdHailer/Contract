## Contract

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring us ([company name]) located at [company address] to [design and develop a web site] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do?

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organisation. You will give us everything we need to complete the project as and when and in the format we need it. You will review our work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you will also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*Us:* We have the experience and ability to do everything we’ve agreed with you and we will do it all in a professional and timely manner. We will endeavour to meet every deadline that’s set (subject to any subsequent changes in scope, etc) and on top of that we'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give us.
<!-- TODO confidentiality might not be necessary -->

## Scope

### Design
<!-- TODO design included for generality but not relevant for purely backend projects  -->

We create look-and-feel designs, and flexible layouts that adapt to the capabilities of many devices and screen sizes. We create designs iteratively and use predominantly HTML and CSS so we will not waste time mocking up every template as a static visual. We may use static visuals to indicate a look-and-feel direction (colour, texture and typography.) We call that ‘design atmosphere.’

### Text content
<!-- TODO database content -->

We are not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy. If you would like us to write new content or input text for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Graphics and/or Photographs

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, we can suggest stock libraries. If you would like us to search for photographs for you, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript

We deliver web page types developed from HTML5 markup, CSS2.1 + 3 stylesheets for styling and unobtrusive JavaScript for feature detection, poly-fills and behaviours.

### Ruby

We deliver web applications developed from Ruby on Rack compatible frameworks. We will use additional technologies where appropriate, such as postgresql for data storage.

### Browser testing

Browser testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person’s experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device.

### Desktop browser testing

We test our work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Google (Chrome) and Mozilla Firefox. If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person’s experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they’re using. We test our work in:

iOS: Safari, Google Chrome
Android 4.x: Google Chrome and Firefox

We currently don’t test Blackberry, Opera Mini/Mobile, Windows Phone or other mobile browsers. If you need us to test using these, we can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Technical support

We are not a website hosting company so we do not offer support for website hosting, email or other services relating to hosting.  If you do not have the capacity to manage your own website hosting (or have alternative third party arrangements), we can, upon request, set up an account for you at one of our preferred hosting providers and charge you accordingly. We can set up your site on a server, plus any statistics software such as Google Analytics and we can provide a separate estimate for that. Then, the updates to, and management of that server will be up to you.

### Changes and revisions

The price at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time we estimate we will need to accomplish everything you have told us you want to achieve, but we will be flexible within reason. If you want to change your mind or add anything new, that will not be a problem as we will provide a separate estimate for that.

You will have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback. We’ll share a working Google Drive with you and have regular, possibly daily contact. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction our work is taking:

- you will give us notice of your intention to terminate (at least 1 business day prior to the date of effective termination), and

- you will pay us in full for everything we have produced up to and including the date of notice.

### Legal stuff

We cannot guarantee that our work will be error-free and so we cannot be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you’ve advised us of them. Our liability will never exceed the cost of the project.

Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

### Copyrights

You warrant that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by you, or that you have permission to use them.

When your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You will own the visual elements that we create for this project. We will give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as we are not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

We will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and we will license its use to you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.

We reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.

### Payments

We are sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that we send you promptly (in any event within 7 days of the date of issue of the invoice). All fees and expenses are minimum estimates only. The fee will be £35 per hour. We will invoice you at the end of every week in which we perform a service for you.

### Miscellaneous

You cannot transfer or assign this contract to anyone else without our permission.

This contract shall continue in full force and effect until terminated by one of the parties, or the conclusion of the project.

This document may be signed in one or more counterparts, each part, when taken together, constituting a single document.

The governing law of this contract is the law of England and Wales. The parties agree that the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of this agreement (including any non-contractual disputes).
